This post will be updated regularly as i find something to say when i on my
macbook machine.

Some regular commands which are executed routinely to make this machine saner.

```shell
# update clojure
brew upgrade clojure

# update jenv versions (e.g) after brew upgrade
jenv add /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/22.0.2/

# update java version to be used globally
jenv global 22.0.2
```
