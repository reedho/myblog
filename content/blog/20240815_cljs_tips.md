## NodeJS package.json "exports" field

_Thursday, 15 Aug 2024_

The `exports` field allows defining the entry points of a package when imported
by name loaded either via a node_modules lookup or a self-reference to its own
name. It is supported in Node.js 12+ as an alternative to the `main` that can
support defining subpath exports and conditional exports while encapsulating
internal unexported modules.

All paths defined in the "exports" must be relative file URLs starting with
`./`.

Contoh ini isi dari field exports untuk npm package `react`.

```json
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "react-server": "./react.shared-subset.js",
      "default": "./index.js"
    },
    "./package.json": "./package.json",
    "./jsx-runtime": "./jsx-runtime.js",
    "./jsx-dev-runtime": "./jsx-dev-runtime.js"
  },
```

Directly import file not conform with the allowed list, e.g.
`/cjs/react.production.min.js` is not permitted.

ShadowCljs versi > 2.20.16 follow this rule and will fail with error something
like below:

```
package react had exports, but could not resolve ./cjs/react.production.min.js
```

To bring back old behavior, use `:js-option {:ignore-exports true}`.
